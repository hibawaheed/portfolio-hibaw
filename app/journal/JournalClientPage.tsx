      <h2>Just a CAIE and Council Dump</h2>
      <p>Okay so it's not that bad. But here's the thing â€” I wasn't stressed about the exams, and because of that, I got stressed. Make it make sense. My friends were having breakdowns, losing sleep, skipping meals... meanwhile I was living like a Victorian child post-plague: 12 hours of sleep, three fat meals, and zero regrets. Food is my only hobby atp (and I think it's visibly obvious).</p>
      
      <h3>Study Plan? Nah</h3>
      <p>Did I study? Not really. Especially not for History because Rocky got injured the day before my mocks and obviously I had to turn into a vet-slash-emotional support provider. Geo was good though because it's actually fun. Past papers go meow. Islamiyat? Mid. I don't hate it, I don't love it, I just coexist with it. Paper 1 is fine. Been there, done that. But Paper 2? It's terrifying. I don't even know why. The battles scare me and I don't want to talk about it.</p>
      
      <p>If there's one thing this syllabus taught me, it's that Sir Abdullah is the GOAT. The rest? Meh. Sir Muzammil just didn't hit this time. Sir Usman is vibing. Sir Jalil's cool too. Now I'm just praying for results because I'd really prefer not to vanish off the face of the academic earth. I'd like to live. Please. If this doesn't work out, I'm applying to Reynash College of Hotel Management and becoming a five-star waiter with a side quest in culinary sadness.</p>

      <p>The post-CAIE feeling is so goofy. I'm updating my website, trying to figure out how I'm already in 11th grade when 9th literally started 5 business minutes ago. Watching my A1 friends (hi Rimmal hi Laiba) suffer in 4K during their exams is such a unique feeling. I don't know if I'm supposed to lay in bed and rot or start prepping for the next CAIE's or what. Chemistry is scary. Physics too. Actually, all sciences are, except CS and ICT. But you know what, even those are scary because I definitely need an A*. Distinction, even :3</p>
      
      <h3>Za Council</h3>
      <p>Now the council sash. It didn't really hit the way I thought it would. I'm sharing the IT Vice position â€” didn't expect it, but it's not a bad thing. I'll get to focus on events and other nonsense without having to juggle everything alone. I think the build-up to the interview made it feel way bigger than it turned out to be. But at the end of the day, I know I'm lucky. A lot of people didn't get positions at all. So I'm learning to appreciate what I've got. Maybe when the new year starts, it'll feel more real. Maybe the sash has some meaning after all.</p>

      <p>Anyway, that's it for today. Time to go contemplate life and eat cereal straight from the box like a functioning human being.</p>

      <p>The system is now operational with temperature, humidity, and motion sensing in all rooms. I've automated lighting in the living room and bedroom, and I'm collecting environmental data that's visualized through a Grafana dashboard.</p>
      
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>I'm planning to expand the system with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Voice control integration using a local speech recognition solution</li>
        <li>Machine learning to predict and optimize energy usage</li>
        <li>Additional security features like door/window sensors</li>
        <li>Integration with my garden irrigation system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started with Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Machine learning can seem intimidating at first, but with the right approach, anyone with programming experience can begin exploring this fascinating field. This guide outlines the steps I took to get started with machine learning, from fundamental concepts to building my first models.</p>
      
      <h3>Understanding the Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>Before diving into code, it's important to understand some core concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Classification vs. Regression:</strong> Classification predicts categories (like spam/not spam), while regression predicts continuous values (like house prices).</li>
        <li><strong>Training, Validation, and Test Sets:</strong> Different data subsets used to build and evaluate models.</li>
        <li><strong>Overfitting and Underfitting:</strong> Common problems where models either memorize training data or fail to capture important patterns.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Essential Tools and Libraries</h3>
      <p>The Python ecosystem offers excellent tools for machine learning:</p>
      <ul>

      <p>To evaluate model performance, I used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root MSE</li>
        <li>R-squared to measure explained variance</li>
        <li>Cross-validation to ensure robust results</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Step 5: Model Tuning</h4>
      <p>Finally, I improved my best model through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hyperparameter tuning using grid search</li>
        <li>Feature selection to focus on the most important variables</li>
        <li>Ensemble methods to combine multiple models</li>

      <h2>My Journey Learning React</h2>
      <p>When I first decided to learn React, I was already familiar with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. However, the component-based architecture and state management concepts of React presented a significant learning curve. Here's the story of my journey, including the challenges I faced and the resources that helped me overcome them.</p>
      
      <h3>The Beginning: Confusion and Frustration</h3>
      <p>My first attempts at learning React were frustrating. I struggled with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding the virtual DOM and JSX syntax</li>
        <li>Grasping the concept of unidirectional data flow</li>
        <li>Managing component state effectively</li>
        <li>Figuring out when to use class vs. functional components</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I started with the official React documentation, which is comprehensive but sometimes assumes prior knowledge that I didn't have. I found myself constantly switching between tutorials, trying to piece together a coherent understanding.</p>
      
      <h3>The Turning Point: Project-Based Learning</h3>
      <p>Everything changed when I adopted a project-based approach. Instead of trying to learn every React concept upfront, I decided to build a simple to-do application. This forced me to apply concepts in a practical context and solve real problems.</p>
      <p>Key breakthroughs during this phase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding component lifecycle by implementing features that depended on it</li>
        <li>Learning state management by tracking to-do items</li>
        <li>Grasping props by creating reusable components</li>
        <li>Implementing event handling for user interactions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Leveling Up: Hooks and Modern React</h3>
      <p>Just as I was getting comfortable with class components, React introduced Hooks. Initially, this felt like starting over, but I soon realized that Hooks simplified many aspects of React development.</p>
      <p>My experience with Hooks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>useState made state management more intuitive</li>
        <li>useEffect consolidated lifecycle methods into a cleaner API</li>
        <li>Custom hooks allowed me to extract and reuse logic</li>
        <li>The transition from class to functional components streamlined my code</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Advanced Concepts: State Management and Beyond</h3>
      <p>As my projects grew more complex, I needed to learn advanced state management. I explored:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Context API for sharing state across components</li>
        <li>Redux for centralized state management</li>
        <li>React Query for server state management</li>
        <li>Performance optimization techniques like memoization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these tools solved specific problems, and learning when to use each one was as important as learning how to use them.</p>
      
      <h3>Resources That Made a Difference</h3>
      <p>These resources were game-changers in my React learning journey:</p>

      <h3>Projects That Cemented My Knowledge</h3>
      <p>These projects helped me apply and retain what I learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A personal portfolio site using React and styled-components</li>
        <li>A weather application that consumed an external API</li>
        <li>A social media dashboard with complex state management</li>
        <li>A collaborative drawing app with React and Socket.io</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Current Focus and Future Learning</h3>
      <p>Now that I'm comfortable with React, I'm focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Server Components and React 19 features</li>
        <li>Micro-frontends architecture</li>
        <li>Accessibility best practices in React applications</li>
        <li>Performance optimization for large-scale applications</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Advice for React Beginners</h3>
      <p>If you're just starting with React, here's my advice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on understanding core concepts before diving into libraries</li>
        <li>Build small projects that gradually increase in complexity</li>
        <li>Don't try to learn everything at once - master fundamentals first</li>
        <li>Join communities like React Discord or Reddit for support</li>
        <li>Read other people's code to learn different approaches</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Learning React has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. It's opened up opportunities for me to build sophisticated web applications and has fundamentally changed how I think about frontend development. If you're on this journey too, keep going - the "aha" moments are worth the initial confusion!</p>
