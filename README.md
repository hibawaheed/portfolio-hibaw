This repo contains the initial version of hibaw.dev, my personal portfolio website. It includes all pages, components, and assets used during development and production.
It also contains extra pages, models and ideas that were made during the dev stage
In apps, the pages displayed are only home, about, journal, and projects - the rest are rejected work
Similarly in the components only the cat and sword model is used, the rest is rejected work
